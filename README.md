# About this Repo

This was PagerDuty's fork of the official Docker image, but now we use a hardened base image for nginx: pd-nginx-docker. Please use it instead. This repo is archived.

This is the Git repo of the official Docker image for [nginx](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/nginx/). See the
Hub page for the full readme on how to use the Docker image and for information
regarding contributing and issues.

The full readme is generated over in [docker-library/docs](https://github.com/docker-library/docs),
specifically in [docker-library/docs/nginx](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/nginx).
